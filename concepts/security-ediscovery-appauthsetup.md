# Setting up App Authentication for Purview eDiscovery with Microsoft Graph API

In the world of data compliance and legal investigations, Purview eDiscovery plays a crucial role in managing and retrieving information across your organizationï¿½s digital landscape. In this age where data breaches are becoming more frequent and the regulatory requirements are more stringent, the security and integrity of eDiscovery processes have never been more critical.  Traditional authentication methods often fall short when it comes to providing the necessary security and compliance guarantees, especially in complex enterprise environments. This is where App Authentication steps in as a game-changer for Purview eDiscovery, leveraging Microsoft Graph API. 

Implementing App Authentication using Microsoft Graph API ensures secure and efficient access to needed resources. This step-by-step guide will walk you through setting up App Authentication for Purview eDiscovery, ensuring your applications are not only compliant but also secure.

## Why App Authentication?

**Enhancing Security and Compliance**
App Authentication enhances the security landscape of Purview eDiscovery by implementing robust authentication protocols that standard user credentials cannot match. By using Application (client) IDs and certificates for authentication, we minimize the risk of credential theft, which is a common vulnerability in standard authentication methods. This approach not only secures the application against unauthorized access but also ensures that the data integrity is maintained during the eDiscovery process.

**Streamlining Access and Integration**
Furthermore, App Authentication streamlines the integration of eDiscovery services with other applications and systems. It facilitates automated, script-based interactions that are crucial for large-scale legal investigations and compliance audits. By allowing secure, token-based access to eDiscovery resources, organizations can automate workflows, reduce manual errors, and ensure consistent enforcement of compliance policies across all digital environments.

## Implementing App Authentication

Listed below are step by step instructions to implement App Auth.  The basic steps involve registering the app in Azure, creating client secret/ certificates, assigning the right API permissions, setting up a service principal and then using App Auth for invocation. Each of these steps are listed in detail below.

Step 1: Register a New Application in Azure

    1.1 To begin, navigate to the Azure portal and sign in with your Microsoft account.
    
    1.2 Access the Microsoft Entra ID section on the left side.
    
    1.3 Go to App registrations, select New registration.
    
    1.4 Provide a meaningful name for your application and click register to create your new app registration. This process will generate essential details such as the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID, which are crucial for future steps.

    1.5 You can now see the newly created app registration and the details.

Step 2: Create Client Secrets or Certificates

Once your app is registered, proceed to **Manage > Certificates & secrets**. Here, you can create a client secret or upload a certificate, depending on your authentication needs:

    For a client secret, click New client secret, add a description, and click Add to save. Make sure to copy and securely store the secret value, as it is needed for authentication.

    If using a certificate, you can upload one to use along with the App ID for automation purposes.

Step 3: Assign API Permissions

Next, you need to set the correct API permissions for your application. Under API permissions, add eDiscovery.Read.All and eDiscovery.ReadWrite.All. These permissions enable your app to read or write eDiscovery data, respectively. It's essential that the tenant admin consents to these Application permissions to enable them for use.

Step 4: Configure Postman for Testing

For API testing, follow the guidance on using Microsoft Graph with Postman. This will help you ensure that your setup is correctly configured before deploying it into production.

Step 5: Set Up a Service Principal

    5.1 In the Azure portal > Microsoft Entra ID, navigate to **Enterprise Applications** to get the Object ID for your application. 
    
    5.2 Now open a new PowerShell session to create a service principal that you will add to the eDiscoveryManager role group:
    
        Install and import the ExchangeOnlineManagement module if not already installed.
            Install-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement (if not already installed)
            Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement
            Connect-IPPSSession
    
        Use New-ServicePrincipal to create a service principal with your app's details and add it to the eDiscoveryManager role using Add-RoleGroupMember.
            New-ServicePrincipal -AppId "71a1f5b9-3c69-4bbd-8579-2b3a2d70f7a0" -ObjectId "72c0d639-8c8f-439b-bbbe-78c9ce51751f" -DisplayName "Graph Api Test"
            Get-ServicePrincipal
            Add-RoleGroupMember -Identity "eDiscoveryManager" -Member "72c0d639-8c8f-439b-bbbe-78c9ce51751f"
    
        Verify the setup using Get-RoleGroupMember.
            Get-RoleGroupMember -Identity "eDiscoveryManager"
            Add-eDiscoveryCaseAdmin -User "72c0d639-8c8f-439b-bbbe-78c9ce51751f"
            Get-eDiscoveryCaseAdmin
