# What's new in Microsoft Graph

Microsoft Graph provides a unified programmability model that you can use to access data in Microsoft 365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility + Security. This article provides information about what's new in Microsoft Graph APIs, documentation, SDKs, and more.

For more detailed API-level updates, see the [Microsoft Graph API changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/changelog/).

For details about previous updates to Microsoft Graph, see [Microsoft Graph what's new history](whats-new-earlier.md).

> Features in _preview_ status are subject to change without notice, and might not be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.

## April 2024: New and generally available

### Applications

Use the upsert capability to create an [application](/graph/api/resources/application), [federatedIdentityCredential](/graph/api/resources/federatedidentitycredential), or [servicePrincipal](/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal) if it doesn't exist, or update an existing object, by using a client-provided key. For more information, see the following API operations:

- [Upsert application](/graph/api/application-upsert)
- [Upsert federatedIdentityCredential](/graph/api/federatedidentitycredential-upsert)
- [Upsert servicePrincipal](/graph/api/serviceprincipal-upsert)

### Groups

Added the [upsert](/graph/api/group-upsert) capability to the [group resource type](/graph/api/resources/group). Use this capability to create a group if it doesn't exist, or update an existing group, by using the **uniqueName** client-provided key.

### Sites and lists

- [Track changes for SharePoint site](/graph/api/site-delta) resources.
- [Track changes for SharePoint list item](/graph/api/listitem-delta) resources.

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in

Configure the [default identity provider](/graph/api/resources/defaultInvitationRedemptionIdentityProviderConfiguration) to use in redemption flow settings for Microsoft Entra ID B2B collaboration.

### Users
Associate users or groups as sponsors for a guest user's privileges in the tenant and keep the guest user's information and access updated. You can [assign a sponsor](/graph/api/user-post-sponsors), [list sponsors](/graph/api/user-list-sponsors), and [remove a sponsor](/graph/api/user-delete-sponsors).

## April 2024: New in preview only

### Industry data ETL

The [outbound provisioning flow set](/graph/api/resources/industrydata-outboundprovisioningflowset), which represents a collection of [outbound provisioning flows](/graph/api/resources/industrydata-provisioningflow) used to configure how school data sync populates data in Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Entra ID, is now generally available.

An outbound provisioning flow set can contain no more than one of each provisioning flow configuration: [userProvisioningFlow](/graph/api/resources/industrydata-userprovisioningflow), [classGroupProvisioingFlow](/graph/api/resources/industrydata-classgroupprovisioningflow), [securityGroupProvisioingFlow](/graph/api/resources/industrydata-securitygroupprovisioningflow), [administrativeUnitProvisioingFlow](/graph/api/resources/industrydata-administrativeunitprovisioningflow).

When calling the [industry data ETL API](/graph/api/resources/industrydata-overview), take advantage of more granular permissions added for reading or writing outbound provisioning flow set data by using the new permissions `IndustryData-OutboundFlow.Read.All` and `IndustryData-OutboundFlow.ReadWrite.All`.

### People and workplace intelligence | People 

Deprecated the `/organization/{organizationId}/settings/itemInsights` endpoint in favor of the new [peopleAdminSettings](/graph/api/resources/peopleadminsettings) resource and introduced the [List](/graph/api/peopleadminsettings-list-iteminsights) method on the **peopleAdminSettings** resource..
