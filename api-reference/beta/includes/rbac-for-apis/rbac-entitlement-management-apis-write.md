In delegated scenarios with work or school accounts, the signed-in user must be assigned a supported [Microsoft Entra role](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json) or a custom role with the `microsoft.directory/entitlementManagement/allProperties/allTasks` role permission. The following least privileged roles are supported for this operation.

- Identity Governance Administrator
