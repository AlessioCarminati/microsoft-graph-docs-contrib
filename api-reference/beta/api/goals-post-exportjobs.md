## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
POST /employeeExperience/goals/exportJobs
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [goalsExportJob](../resources/goalsexportjob.md) object.

You can specify the following properties when you create a **goalsExportJob** object.

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|goalsOrganizationId|String|The unique identifier of the [Viva Goals organization](/viva/goals/understand-orgs-and-teams#organizations-in-viva-goals).|
|explorerViewId|String|The unique identifier of the explorer view to be exported.|

You can get the **goalsOrganizationId** and **explorerViewId** values from the URL of a [Explorer view](/viva/goals/explorer#default-views-in-explorer).

``` http
https://goals.microsoft.com/org_uuid/94a356ab-53d5-40e7-8a85-053d6d3b9eb3/objective-explorer?viewId=e5e7a3c1-8cdf-409d-9ce9-ff730d65d95e
```
- The `org_uuid` in the URL, in this example `94a356ab-53d5-40e7-8a85-053d6d3b9eb3`, represents the **goalsOrganizationId**.
- The `viewId` in the URL, in this example `e5e7a3c1-8cdf-409d-9ce9-ff730d65d95e`, represents the **explorerViewId**.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [goalsExportJob](../resources/goalsexportjob.md) object in the response body.

This method also returns `409 Conflict` when you attempt to create a [goalsExportJob](../resources/goalsexportjob.md) object with the same values (**goalsOrganizationId** and **explorerViewId**) as an existing [goalsExportJob](../resources/goalsexportjob.md) object that is pending completion. 

When the pending job completes, you can create the new [goalsExportJob](../resources/goalsexportjob.md) object.
